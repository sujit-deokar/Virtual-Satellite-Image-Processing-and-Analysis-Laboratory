# Virtual-Satellite-Image-Processing-and-Analysis-Laboratory
This repositrory is with reference to experiments performed in Virtual labs which can referred to site http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/csre/siplabs/index.jsp. All experiments are performed using Python. Which is an effort to make python codes available for same problem statements. It has no direct connections with VLABs.
List of Experiments:

1. Viewing images in different bands

2. Contrast Enhancement

3. Smoothing

4. Principal Component Analysis

5. Edge Detection

6. Frequency Domain Filtering (Fourier Transform)

7. Mathematical Morphology

8. Indices

9. K-Means Clustering

10. Color Transform

11. Maximum Likelihood Classification

12. Neural Network Based Classification

13. Accuracy Assessment

14. Texture Analysis
