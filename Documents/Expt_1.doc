	Images are the most distinctly and suitable way of conducting or transmitting information. An image is worth a thousand words. Images clearly convey information about mutually relating different objects, shape and various spatial features. In particular spatial information such as object classification & recognizing. Being humans we are pretty much good at inferring information from images, because of our inherent visual intellect. More than 75% of the information received by human is in visual form. In the today’s context, image analysis is employed on critical perspective, including the color bands.
